# Covid-19 Positivity Rate Prediction Project

### This project is about the data mining of Covid-19 data, as well as building a prediction model based on the data gathered. It was made during the "Data Mining" course at CEID, University of Patras. It is divided into two main parts.

### First Part
---
In the first part, after we collected the data, we focused on analyzing it and drew some conclusions. Then, we proceeded to clean the data, fill any missing values and finally, we performed a clustering using k-means based on each country's performance in dealing with the virus.

### Second Part
---
In the second part, we built two different models to predict the positivity rate of Covid-19 cases 3 days after the end of the given data. One was based on RNNs and the other one was based on SVMs. Finally, we compared the outputs of the models and drew our final results.
